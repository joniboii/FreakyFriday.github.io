<!-- 
    MY PARTNERS TASK:
    I own a sushi restaurant and I want a website where customers can easily read the information about my restaurant, 
    and where they can easily see the menu. I don’t want to have any flashing exciting webpage, 
    but an easily accessible website where you can look at the menu and order a table at a specific time. 
    I want a dark and modern theme that will represent my restaurant cuisine. I also want to have information about where my restaurant location is.

                This is carbon neutral sushi, handmade from fresh, certified and sustainable ingredients. 
                Pair with organic wine and some friends for an enhanced experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                The idea for Sushibar + Wine came from a simple revelation. 
                Despite the fact that they come from opposite corners of the world, 
                sushi and the Nordic aesthetic are made for each other. 
                The highlight of the tasting experience was the addition of a third highly designed component: 
                organic wines from small, independent producers. When seemingly different things are combined, 
                they can create something completely unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Environment, sustainable development and being environmentally friendly and ethical are matters 
                of the heart for us at Sushibar + Wine. We are the first carbon-neutral sushi restaurant in 
                Helsinki as well as in Oslo. We have received the highly respected ASC / MSC Chain of Custody 
                and EcoCompass sustainability certificates. We are also proud of our partnership with WWF. 
                Our green values ​​are visible in our daily work, and we strive to continuously develop and 
                become even more environmentally friendly.

            <h2>NEWS LETTER</h2>
            <p>
                19.05.2020 ----
                Sushibar+Wine is Norway’s first MSC- and ASC-certified sushi restaurant
                Sushibar+Wine opened its first restaurant in Oslo in March. 
                On 6 May 2020, it became the first Norwegian sushi restaurant to be awarded both the MSC and ASC certificates. 
                The MSC and ASC traceability certificates for seafood demonstrate that the seafood products in our restaurants 
                are traceable and verifiably sourced in a responsible manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                20.03.2020 ----
                The world is changing and we want to evolve simultaneously
                The world is at a stand still and the environmental effects are already visible. 
                As a carbon neutral company we are happy for the environmental changes, 
                but concerned whether it is possible for us to provide our services in a post-crisis environment. 
                Your support is more important than ever!
